Very good or better; mild toning along edges where framed mat once was, tape remnant from same to top edge.  Both unobtrusive. Single manuscript page from Burroughs' short story \"to talk for Joe the Dead\" from his collection TORNADO ALLEY (Cherry Valley, 1989 - provided).  This portion corresponds to pp. 17-18 from that edition.Typed and dated April 16, 1983, the piece likely originated from Burroughs' journal as several lines at the beginning of the page seem to record a dream featuring Allen Ginsberg not mentioned in the published version.  Several hand corrections to typescript as well as two informative notes to upper and lower margins in Burroughs' hand. The first: \"He's going to kill his doctor (me)\".  The second explains the origins of the story: \"This is an extension of Jerry Wallace story about a criminal boy 7 feet tall.  I said, \"He'd better abreviate [sic?] himself\".

The photographs were taken by an unknown person who accompanied Burroughs on his South American expedition to research the use of yage by local curanderos, a journey chronicled in The Yage Letters. They show Burroughs in his pith helmet and safari clothes, in one photo wielding a machete, in another posing with a long rifle, and in the third he's standing with two native children. The 5\" x 7\" photographs are corner-mounted on paper that simulates the bark of the Banisteria caapi vine. The pages are bound into covers of richly textured, sumptuous hand-made paper bound at the spine with brass screws. The booklet was designed and hand-assembled by Johnny Brewton of X-Ray Book Co. in an edition limited to only 26 lettered copies. The photographs, two of which are previously unpublished, were reproduced from the original negatives and are the only prints to be made from these negatives. This first publication from Skyline Books is a nice companion to The Yage Letters, providing an intriguing look at William Burroughs as explorer and ethnobotanist.
